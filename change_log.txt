Hello! this is SlimeStaff! From 1.1.0-1, there will now be change logs!

1.1.0-1:
    Fixed an input logic glitch where pressing backspace or enter would break the game (props to just awakening for finding this one :P)
    
1.1.0-2:
    Fixed a bunch of logical errors, and added a new cheat!
    When in the cheat terminal, if you input 420, you'll be able to skip as many rooms you want.
    
1.1.0-3:
    Added colors for the suits, and values for the letter cards in the tutorial!
    Courtesy of my dear friend Simon!

1.1.0-4:
    Added compatibility with windows!

1.1.0-5:
    Fixed compatibility bug with windows and a bug where the 420 cheat wouldn't work if the first action has been done.

1.1.1:
    Added a new option in the configurations panel:
        "reset saves" - resets both your saves
        
    Added the / command "set":
        /set [variable] [value]
        E.g.:
            /set player.hp 999
            > will set the player's HP to 999
    
    Added the / command "exec":
        /exec [code]
        E.g.:
            /exec globals()["difficulty"] = "normal"
            > will set the difficulty to normal

1.1.1-1:
    Changed the option to discard the weapon from 1 to 2
